# Fluent
TODO(mwhittaker): Copy some of the comments in `fluent_builder.h` and
`fluent_executor.h` into here and explain how to use the fluent library.

## Lineage
Here's a brief overview of how distributed lineage is implemented in Fluent.
We store all lineage information in PostgreSQL (for now). To explain what
exactly is stored, it's best to look at an example:

```c++
zmq::context_t context(1);
postgres::ConnectionConfig config = GetConnectionConfig();
postgres::PqxxClient client(config);

auto f = fluent("my_program", "inproc://addr", &context, &client)
  .table<int, char>("my_table")
  .scratch<int>("my_scratch")
  .channel<std::string, float>("my_channel")
  .RegisterRules([](auto& t, auto& s, auto& c) {
    using namespace fluent::infix;
    return std::make_tuple(s <= c.Iterable(), t <= s.Iterable());
  };
```

This fluent program has three collections---

- a table `my_table(int, char)`,
- a scratch `my_scratch(int)`, and
- a channel `my_channel(std::string, float)`.

---and two rules:

- `s <= c.Iterable` and
- `t <= s.Iterable()`

Information about this program, its collections, and its rules are found in the
`Nodes`, `Collections`, and `Rules` tables within the postgres database.

- The `Nodes(id, name)` relation holds the name and id (the hash of the name)
  for every fluent program.
- The `Collections(node_id, collection_name)` relation holds the name of every
  collection of every fluent program.
- The `Rules(node_id, rule_number, rule)` relation holds every rule of every
  fluent program.

```
> SELECT * FROM Nodes;
+----+------------+
| id | name       |
|----+------------|
| 42 | my_program |
+----+------------+

> SELECT * FROM Collections;
+---------+-----------------+
| node_id | collection_name |
|---------+-----------------|
| 42      | my_table        |
| 42      | my_sratch       |
| 42      | my_channel      |
+---------+-----------------+

> SELECT * FROM Rules;
+---------+-------------+----------+
| node_id | rule_number | rule     |
|---------+-------------+----------|
| 42      | 0           | Iterable |
| 42      | 1           | Iterable |
+---------+-------------+----------+
```

The postgres database also has a relation for every collection of every
program. For a program `p` and collection `c`, the relation is named `p_c`. The
schema of the relation is the same as the schema of `c` with three additional
columns prepended: the hash of the tuple, the logical time at which the tuple
was inserted, and the logical time at which the tuple was deleted.

```
> \d my_program_my_table
+---------------+---------+-----------+
| Column        | Type    | Modifiers |
+---------------+---------+-----------+
| hash          | bigint  | not null  |
| time_inserted | integer | not null  |
| time_deleted  | integer |           |
| col_0         | integer | not null  |
| col_1         | char(1) | not null  |
+---------------+---------+-----------+

> \d my_program_my_scratch
+---------------+---------+-----------+
| Column        | Type    | Modifiers |
+---------------+---------+-----------+
| hash          | bigint  | not null  |
| time_inserted | integer | not null  |
| time_deleted  | integer |           |
| col_0         | integer | not null  |
+---------------+---------+-----------+
```

Additionally, for each program `p`, we generate a `p_lineage` table:

```
> \d my_program_lineage
+---------------------+---------+-----------+
| Column              | Type    | Modifiers |
+---------------------+---------+-----------+
| dep_node_id         | bigint  | not null  |
| dep_collection_name | text    | not null  |
| dep_tuple_hash      | bigint  | not null  |
| rule number         | integer | not null  |
| inserted            | boolean | not null  |
| collection_name     | text    | not null  |
| tuple_hash          | bigint  | not null  |
| time                | integer | not null  |
+---------------------+---------+-----------+
```

where a tuple `(dn, dc, dt, r, i, c, t, time)` represents that the tuple `dt`
in collection `dc` on node `dn` was used by rule `r` to insert (if `i` is true)
or delete (if `i` is false) the tuple `t` into collection `c` at time `time`.

TODO(mwhittaker): Explain how logical time works.
